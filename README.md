# Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Feed Reader Testing
This project is the 6th project in Udacity Frontend Web developer nanodegree.  It uses the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) framework to perform tests on an already developed web application. The existing application displays articles from a site via an RSS feed and allows the user to select a new site and update the articles displayed to the selected site.

With the Jasmine library integrated into the page, a web developer can write tests against the site, and see the test results right in the site, or in another page depending on how the project is set up. For this project the test results are displayed directly in the main page of the app.

The web app has a number of suites of tests performed, which include:
* Ensure that RSS Feeds are defined, have urls, and are named
The feed selector menu is hidden by default and changes visibility (i.e. is toggled) when clicked.
* Initial Entries are populated when the page loads.
* New Feed Selection should change the header tile and should change feed links and descriptions.
